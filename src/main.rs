//! Rustbox: A Rust based implementation of the Firefox Accounts Sync Storage service
//!
//! This app provides the FxA sync storage service (a.k.a pushbox). The idea being that
//! WebPush allows for small messages, but large, multipart messages can be problematic
//! for multiple reasons. Instead, FxA would use Pushbox as an imtermediary store, and
//! send the UA a link to data that it could fetch.
